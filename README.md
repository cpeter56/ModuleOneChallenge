#Utilizing Artificial Intelligence for Aphasia Treatment in Medicine.


## For what and why? It's oddly specific, no doubt. I think the reasons behind this may be more helpful.


Back in 2018 my younger brother had a stroke. The difficulties stroke patients deal with are tremendous to say the least. One of the issues that emerged I personally find troubling. It's called aphasia.


What is aphasia you may be asking? "Aphasia is a communication disorder. It may affect speech, the ability to write as well as the processing of just understanding speech and writing. It can arise from a stroke, traumatic brain injury or degeneration (Mayo clinic)". 


My goal is to give voice to those who are affected by this horrible condition. How can one who is affected with language difficulties be the best advocate for themselves if they can't say so? In addition to that, there's a critical window in the rehabilitation phase post stroke and TBI to get the best outcomes as soon as possible as the further you get away from the date of the incident the road to recovery becomes exponentially greater to overcome and eventually it may even shut completely. During this window it is imperative that these patients have a voice to advocate for themselves so they don't get lost or forgotten about in this system.


For the record, there is no company. What I am embarking on is something that extends out of research and has only been theorized by researchers, at best. However, I am not a researcher and to progress in this field will be quasi research with me partnering with local speech therapists hopefully at the Craig Hospital here in Denver where I can provide the technology portion and with their guidance I can develop a suitable solution. With that being said, most of these proposals have come out of the year 2024, so to say it would be a race to my idea of a concept and into the field as soon as possible would not be an understatement.


"There is a tremendous need for these sorts of tools and while there was a ton of interest in these sorts of things in 2019 with the way AI has advanced over the last 5 years there's new opportunities and it should be reassessed. In particular there's two main ways to go about this, context aware technologies to assess ambient noise and proposing relevant vocabulary. What the researchers have done, is looked at all of this since the year 1990 but even then there's relatively limited results as this is such a hot topic with little advancements throughout the decades, with only 663 eligible articles from this range varying widely in assessments." (Scoping Review)


What's the primary focus of AI they determined in this study? I can be broken down into a few categories. "The first one is in diagnostics, the second is for therapy, the third is creating models that deal with adding new words, and when a patient uses the wrong word or meaning (Scoping Review)." This leads to a massive opportunity in the device markets themselves. "Ultimately the authors of this article did not find any ai used in communication devices themselves, only applications on ipads." (Scoping Review)


"Now this leads to some problems on the research side. It looks like there's an astounding amount of collaboration between scientists and their studies but when it comes to having something such as a centralized repository where all the data is kept together, there isn't one at the moment leaving massive amounts of data decentralized, for neurodegenerative disorders. Another is that individuals with severe aphasia, they likely would not have the skills to be able to use such a device in the first place." (Scoping Review)


What I envision is the use of augmented reality that can suggest words or sentences to the patients. This is an extremely complicated problem to solve which as the authors conclude will take a considerable amount of research and more importantly funding to be able to achieve. With that being said it's a problem worth solving as everyone deserves a voice.
